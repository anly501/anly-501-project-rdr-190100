      <p> Regardless of where you live, it is quite evident that the traffic in the metropolitan area is a major issue that affects us in numerous ways. At the micro-level it makes our daily schedules highly disrupted whereas at the macro-level it causes huge economic losses. Needless to mention, 
          but also the inherent environmental pollution that comes with congestion, which is well explained in the article by Telegraph. While there are many ideas and solutions to improve traffic flow, not many of them have shown promising results. Thus, as a part of the assessment, we were asked 
          to propose a comprehensive AI-based solution to address the above-said issue. Even in well developed and metropolitan cities, traffic is one of the issues that needs to be resolved because a poorly designed traﬃc light can lead to increased vehicle delay 
          and road incidents, causing traﬃc congestion, and may encourage drivers to takealternative routes that may not be suitable for traﬃc (such as routes throughresidential neighbourhoods). I believe that Data science and Machine Learning has a solution for this.
          To date, research on urban traﬃc optimization has been relatively scarce due tothe complex and random nature of intra-city traﬃc in comparison to highways.However, the desire to model this complexity and the dire need for improvingit, and traﬃc ﬂow, recently attracted serious 
          interest from both academia and commercial entities. Apart from Data analysis and pre-processing the project has 2 main steps. First step is to use Object Detection and ML to detect vehicles at every single traffic light in a specific area. Spatial distance can also be calculated 
          between the detected vehicles to find the intensity of traffic at any traffic signal at any point of time. The second part is to create a Machine Learning model which automatically takes in consideration,  for a particular traffic light, the traffic intensity of the previous and next 
          signals and automates the working of green lights in order to minimize traffic. So for instance if for a particular signal the traffic is increasing at a previous signal, the model should work on keep this signal and other signals green while also taking in consideration the traffic 
          intensity at other signals for the opposite lane.
