      <p> Formula One (F1) is a series of races held at different venues around the world, of the fastest open-wheel, open-cabin, single-seated, four-wheeled autos in the world. There have been a few years when even six-wheeled cars participated in F1. The word “Formula”, included in the name, refers to a set of rules that the constructors of the car, its mechanics and the drivers have to strictly follow during the tenure that they are members of F1. When motor racing first began, there were no limitations on the power or the size of the cars. The races became unequal with cars with more power and bigger sizes easily outpacing the smaller cars. The races also created dangerous situations in which many participants got seriously hurt, some even fatally. When racing resumed after World War II, the governing body of the sport, the FIA, introduced a set of rules that set limits on the size and the power of the cars. This created an even playing field for the participants and drivers, while more stress was laid on the efficiency and design of the cars and also the capability of the drivers. Formula 1 cars are data-driven, intelligent systems that can reach speeds of over 200 mph. There have been more people in space than have driven an F1 car. These Formula One racers are the pinnacle of automobile technology. Hundreds of sensors monitor every aspect of each vehicle, including lap times, tyre and brake temperatures, air flow, and engine performance. Hundreds of stories are unfolding behind the scenes as you watch a race, such as tyre wear, engine health, and driver responsiveness. Few sports use data analytics as extensively as Formula One — it influences the design of the cars, how they are driven, and how the race is aired. Prior to the adoption of data analytics, a race’s success or failure was entirely determined by the driver’s split-second decisions on the track. By the 1970s, however, telemetry systems had shrunk in size and sophistication to the point where they could be installed in vehicles to provide information about their operation.Electronic systems were commonly installed on F1 vehicles by the 1980s. Initially, storage was limited to a single lap’s worth of data, and drivers were given a signal to turn on the telemetry when the team needed to collect data. The data would then be removed from the vehicle and transferred to computer systems in the garage for further analysis. By the end of the decade, ‘burst’ telemetry had been developed, which sent radio signals from the car to the garage during a race, giving the pit crew advance warning of the car’s physical condition. These bursts were replaced by streaming data, which was piped back to the garage and then to the factory. Pre-race simulations, real-time decision-making by analysts and pit crew, post-race analysis, and the broadcast experience are all influenced by real-time data streams today. 
          Considering so much of the data stored after every lap and as the level of racing between different teams is now more or less even with respect to engine sizes, weight and fuel tanks, there are a ton of other factors that influence the result of any particular race in a season, I thought of creating my project based on this data. The main aim of this project is to observe how these factors influence the results of a race and use these observations to build a model that predicts the results of a race.

  <p>Q1: How has the popularity of F1 increased over the years? </p> 
  <p>Q2: Which constructor (team) has the highest support every season? </p> 
  <p>Q3: Does the changing of car rules every few years affect the results of the race? </p> 
  <p>Q4: Do tyres play an important role in winning any race?  </p> 
  <p>Q5: How do the pit leaders and team strategists affect the result of a race?</p> 
  <p>Q6: Do the number of drivers affect seasonwise performace of drivers?</p> 
  <p>Q7: Do the number of teams affect seasonwise performace of drivers?  </p> 
  <p>Q8: Do the number of races in a season affect the performace of drivers? </p> 
  <p>Q9: How does weather play an important role for winning a race? </p> 
  <p>Q10: Is historic data relevant ans preferred to use while predicting future races?  </p>
