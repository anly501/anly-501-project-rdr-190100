      <p> Formula One (F1) is a series of races held at different venues around the world, of the fastest open-wheel, open-cabin, single-seated, four-wheeled autos in the world. There have been a few years when even six-wheeled cars participated in F1. The word ‘Formula’, included in the name, refers to a set of rules that the constructors of the car, its mechanics and the drivers have to strictly follow during the tenure that they are members of F1. When motor racing first began, there were no limitations on the power or the size of the cars. The races became unequal with cars with more power and bigger sizes easily outpacing the smaller cars. The races also created dangerous situations in which many participants got seriously hurt, some even fatally. When racing resumed after World War II, the governing body of the sport, the FIA, introduced a set of rules that set limits on the size and the power of the cars. This created an even playing field for the participants and drivers, while more stress was laid on the efficiency and design of the cars and also the capability of the drivers. As the level of racing between different teams is now more or less even with respect to engine sizes, weight and fuel tanks, there are a ton of other factors that influence the result of any particular race in a season. The main aim of this project is to observe how these factors influence the results of a race and use these observations to build a model that predicts the results of a race.      </p>

  <p>Q1: How has the popularity of F1 increased over the years? </p> 
  <p>Q2: Which constructor (team) has the highest support every season? </p> 
  <p>Q3: Does the changing of car rules every few years affect the results of the race? </p> 
  <p>Q4: Do tyres play an important role in winning any race?  </p> 
  <p>Q5: How do the pit leaders and team strategists affect the result of a race?</p> 
  <p>Q6: Do the number of drivers affect seasonwise performace of drivers?</p> 
  <p>Q7: Do the number of teams affect seasonwise performace of drivers?  </p> 
  <p>Q8: Do the number of races in a season affect the performace of drivers? </p> 
  <p>Q9: How does weather play an important role for winning a race? </p> 
  <p>Q10: Is historic data relevant ans preferred to use while predicting future races?  </p>
